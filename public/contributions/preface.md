# Extended dataset documentation

The complete curated set of relaxed three-dimensional crystal structures is based on raw CIF data taken from the external experimental databases. For some materials additional properties have been calculated by external collaborators. The methodology used in these external datasets may differ slightly to that outlined in the base dataset. See below for the details on methodology on specific datasets.
